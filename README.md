# The waiter robot
This project is about creating a robot which will be able to serve people in restaurants or bars with the minimum interactions with the users. 
We are a group of three 17yo friends working on this for a school project, one is working on the mechanical aspect, the other one is working on the motors and the battery and I'm working on the whole algorithm.

## How does it work?
To make it simple, a user put the plates on the robot's arms, then with the touchscreen enter the table id.
The robot will follow black lines on the ground thanks to the camera. Each QR Codes on the ground will act as "nodes", telling the robot what direction take depending the table id.
Once the robot in front of the table, it will down its arms to give the plates, after this it will go back to the counter, waiting for a new command.

## Remark
This project is not intended for the public, I'm just putting my work here for personal purposes. However you can take whatever you want from it!
